### Hi there, humans ðŸ‘½

I'm Luca, I'm a university student currently enrolled in the __Computer Science and Engineering__ Master's degree course at Politecnico di Milano.
What interests me the most in these huge and fascinating field are in particular Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and space exploration.

Until now, my accademic journey allowed me to learn a lot of things, from engineering basics to programming languages and teamwork.
I've learned so much, but still, there's a lot to learn.
